## Notice

There are issues that need be brought up when using this dictionary.

First, the linguistic diversity of the Philippines is vast. Variations in pronunciation and spelling will varry across tribes, hillsides, barrios and even clans. Therefore this dictionary will also be writing the localities to accompany language codes from ISO 639. In the case where these variations may occur too many, we might have to keep it in one entry.

The entries in this dictionary follows the format in which the local name comes first, followed by the language and/or locality the entries are present. As much as possible, the meaning and/or etymology of the word will be written, even when a scientific name is already provided. In a case where many words from many languages can be traced to a proto-language, the words will be written under the proto-word following the same formal under the first section of the dictionary.

Status of scientific names will be hyperlinked in which you can find the author and the publication. In a case where the publication can not be traced and/or a generic epithet was used to signify many genera, the paper that used the scientific name will be cited.

Our dictionary uses various books, papers and living people as sources to verify these entries. However, errors such as incorrect spelling will happen. Additionally, the field of mycology is very new to science, so scientific names will always change by the day. Which is why we encourage you to help us in improving our dictionary by contacting us.

Some mushrooms named might not be currently attested in the Philippines and might not have any local names like the *Amanita muscaria*. However, they have been added because of previous instances and imports from the mushroom-culture world.
